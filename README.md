Creating my first repository (training)

Hello!

I am a Staff Programmer Analyst for an insurance company.   

For 23+ years I have have been a mainframe programmer/analyst.

Primarily coding in COBOL, CICS, JCL, DB2, VSAM, etc.

Within the last year I was chosen to move over to a new team converting our policy administration systems from our legacy mainframe systems to a new Duck Creek policy administration system.

This involves learning the Duck Creek platforms as well as XML, XHTML, CSS, Java, etc.

I've join several Tech Groups within the last 2 years to enhance my skillsets.

One of which is Hack-4-Good which I am looking forward to learning a lot from this fine young group of talented software developers.
